Description
Automatic extraction of properties from the scientific literature of superalloy, covering density, Î³' solvus temperature, solidus temperature, and liquidus temperature. Starting with a corpus of scientific articles scraped in XML or plain text format, NLP techniques are used to preprocess the raw archived corpus, followed by sentence classification, named entity recognition and relation extraction automatically. Finally, the extracted entities containing alloy named entity, property specifier and property value, are compiled into a highly structured format for materials database.
